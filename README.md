# Homework_06_Weather_API

Here is a functional weather application that provides current weather data, and a 5-day forecast for whatever city a user searches for. There are also buttons for popular cities on the page so that you can easily access weather info for those cities. 

For this project I used 2 API's:
Open Weather One Call API
Open Weather Current Weather Data

All of the styling for this webpage was done with bootstrap, and it is responsive so that it can be viewed on a mobile device.
